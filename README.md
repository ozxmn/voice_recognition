# Voice Recognition App

Python voice recognition system using ML.  

---

## Features
- Record and label voice samples  
- Train and save a recognition model (`model.pkl`)  
- Test recognition with confidence scores  
- Clean CustomTkinter GUI  
- Modular structure for easy maintenance

cd voice_recognition
```

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```text
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*if it's not working, try

```
3️⃣ Run the App
```text
python main.py
```
*if it's not working, try
```text
py main.py
```

## How it works
- Record samples for each person in the dataset (`data/person_name_folder`).
- Train model → creates `model.pkl`.
- Test recognition → identifies who is speaking based on trained data.

⚠️ **Note:** The **Test Recognition** button is disabled until a trained model exists.


## Dependencies
- customtkinter
- sounddevice
- soundfile
- numpy
- librosa
