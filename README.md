# 🎙️ Voice Recognition App

A simple, modular Python voice recognition system with a modern GUI built using **CustomTkinter**.  
It is useful you to audio, train a model, and recognize speakers — all in one clean interface.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎧 Record and label voice samples  
- 🧠 Train and save a recognition model (`model.pkl`)  
- 🔍 Test recognition with confidence scores  
- 🪶 Clean CustomTkinter GUI  
- ⚙️ Modular structure for easy maintenance

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
(*type all of this in the VS Code terminal*)

1️⃣ Download

cd voice_recognition
```

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```text
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*if it's not working, try

```
*if it's not working, try
```text
py main.py
```

## 🧠 How It Works
- Record samples for each person in the dataset (`data/person_name_folder`).
- Train model → creates `model.pkl`.
- Test recognition → identifies who is speaking based on trained data.

⚠️ **Note:** The **Test Recognition** button is disabled until a trained model exists.


## 🧰 Dependencies
- customtkinter
- sounddevice
- soundfile
- numpy
- librosa
- scikit-learn
